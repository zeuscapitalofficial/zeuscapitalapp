# auth & utility

Detailed flag specifications for `resend auth` and utility commands.

---

## auth login

| Flag | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `--key <key>` | string | Yes (non-interactive) | API key (must start with `re_`) |

Pass the key from an environment variable (e.g. `--key "$RESEND_API_KEY"`) or a secret manager — never as a literal, which would persist in shell history and logs.

Lists all profiles with active marker.

---

## auth switch
